#### About this dataset

* Uses small area estimates to produce high-quality, small-area epidemiologic data for small regions within cities. 
* This system complements existing surveillance data necessary to more fully understand the health issues affecting the residents of that city or census tract.
* Can be used both by individual cities and groups of cities as well as other stakeholders to:
  a. help develop and implement effective and targeted prevention activities;
  a. identify emerging health problems; 
  a. and establish and monitor key health objectives.
For example, city planners and elected officials may want to use this data to target neighborhoods with high rates of smoking or other health risk behaviors for effective interventions.
